<h1>Autonomous Mini Cart</h1>

The Mini Cart is designed to follow directions without pre-programmed instructions. The end
user can simply point in the desired direction of travel and the robot will react accordingly.

<h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
<hr>

The Mini Cart is powered by a Raspberry Pi; the Pi is responsible for all ML computations, 
capturing pictures via the Pi-Camera, and reacting by powering servo motors with GPIO 
(General Purpose Input Output) pins.
